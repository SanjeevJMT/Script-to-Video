Jupiter has 79 known moons, more than any other planet. Its four largest moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, are known as the Galilean moons, named after Galileo Galilei, who first observed them in 1610. These moons exhibit a wide range of geological activity, from volcanoes on Io to a potentially habitable ocean beneath Europa's icy surface.
