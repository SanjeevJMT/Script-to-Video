Gita:
The first chapter sets the scene on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where two armies - the Pandavas and Kauravas - are ready for war. Duryodhana approaches his teacher Drona and lists the major warriors on both sides. Arjuna, accompanied by Lord Krishna as his charioteer, asks to be positioned between the armies to observe the warriors he must fight.
When Arjuna sees his relatives, teachers, and friends in the opposing army, he's overwhelmed with grief and moral conflict. He expresses his deep anguish to Krishna about having to kill his own family members, especially his respected grandfather Bhishma and teacher Drona. He fears that killing family members will destroy their dynasty and traditional values.
Arjuna argues that no good can come from killing his own people, and material gains like kingdom and pleasures mean nothing if his loved ones are dead. Overcome by sorrow and confusion about his duty (dharma), he drops his bow Gandiva and declares that he would rather not fight than kill his family members.
This chapter establishes the central conflict that leads to Krishna's divine discourse in subsequent chapters.
